# GameDesign
Conceptualizing, designing, and planning the development of a large-scale web or mobile application/game

- **Introduction:** Even to this day classics like connect 4, tic-tac-toe, and pong are played as a quick and simple pass time either in between study sessions or even in class. "X" aims to provide a refreshing take on classic games that provided entertainment to all of us in our previous years and presumably in our years to come. With the hopes of providing a new layer of depth to your favorite games, users will become more hooked than ever before.

- **Value/Use:** Similar to online game portals like "CoolMathGames", "X" will provide easy and simple access to a catalouge of revamped classic games only a click away. Furthermore, due to the nature of its design (being a web app), monetization through advertisements will be incredibly simple to implement all while not hindering the users experience with intersitial ads aka "full-screen ads". 
  
- **User Interaction and Experience:** Many of the games provided on the grid-like web page will be "single-session games", albeit updated, like "pong". This style of of games allows users to try out the web page's entire catalouge if they happened to exhaust a particular game. Furthermore, this level of accessibilty makes it the ideal webpage to visit if you only have a limited amount of free time with a buddy, want to quickly destress, or you're in the middle of class and want to look busy. If a game does play better with  save states, the user can be prompted to register an account if they would like to return to the game. "X" will strive towards simplicity within its gameplay and even user interface. 
  
- **Competitive Element:** With the option to play local multiplayer or even online multiplayer most, if not all, of the catalouge of games will incorporate some sort of competitive element to keep the user engaged. Additionally, unlike other online game portals, if a user is registered with "X" a leaderboard of your friends list can display: total hours played, total amount of wins accumulated, etc.
  
- **Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies:** An explanation of the features or strategies employed to make the application/game engaging and addictive.
  
- **Scalability and Expansion:** A discussion of how the design allows for future growth and adoption beyond the initial homework assignment.
  
- **Accessibility and Inclusivity:** A section detailing how the design adheres to the California non-discrimination clause and ensures inclusivity for all potential users.
